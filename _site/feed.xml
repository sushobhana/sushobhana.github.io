regions package. The parser that I implemented seems to work and catches most of
the syntax errors pretty well. The test cases that I have added seems to be
proof of it. It has been merged to the master trunk now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the last blog post, I have done a couple of things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier there was no method to convert regions object to Shape object. The Shape
class was only used to deserialise io file format but not the other way around.
The writer for DS9 file format is being directly converted to string from
regions object for now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, it is important that we need to use the Shape layer while serialisation for
a couple of reasons. Most importantly, it helps to interchange file formats
seamlessly. How? You convert regions object to Shape object . There are methods
for Shape objects to convert from CRTF to DS9 format and vice-versa. Then there
are to_ds9 and to_crtf methods to convert them into respective strings. I
implemented methods such as to_shape_list that were not present before , and
refactored the ds9_objects_to_string methods without breaking things down. I
have proposed it in the following pull request which is under scrutiny now, but
I believe it’s going to be merged
soon.(&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/astropy/regions/pull/179&quot;&gt;https://github.com/astropy/regions/pull/179&lt;/a&gt;)Another
challenging part was to convert meta data in one file format to another file
format. To solve this, I created RegionMeta and RegionVisual subclasses from
Python dict, which checks the validation of the keys.It contains methods which
returns io format compatible meta dictionaries which eases the serialization
process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, I had my first video chat with my mentors Adam and Miguel. Apart from
a few technical glitches initially and me being little nervous and blabbering
throughout, it turned out pretty well , all thanks to my cool mentors. The
thirty to forty minutes conversation has setup our course for the next two
phases of coding period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first one was to create a test suite for CRTF , making sure that everything
works as expected. It is big of a deal, because we have very limited samples of
the region files and we need ample of them to test them regressively . Until we
collect them , we decided to test some part by converting DS9 files to CRTF and
then checking them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, comes handling of the third dimensions (spectral) of the regions. This was
a very broad and challenging question because there are no specific standard for
handling them , and implementing them without any motivation is certainly a not
wise way. So, we decided to interface the regions with spectral-cube. In this
way, regions object object can be used to mask data cube , and we will have
another real application of regions package. Now, to extract a subcube from a
ds9 region, we use pyregions to parse it. Our motive is to replace it wih the
regions package . Also, we would want to use CRTF regions and use the spectral
parameters to extract a spectral slab . In this way, we can come up with ways to
handle the spectral parameters in regions as suitable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also discussed to completely replace photutils aperture machinery with
regions shapes.But, our first priority is to integrate spectral-cubes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My summer vacations have started , and I am back home. So, I have decided to
escalate things up . To setup milestones in the progress , I have decided to
come up with weekly blog posts and so that I become a little more motivated.
This week, I have decided to implement the writer of CRTF (now that I am clear
of it’s design) which will be a matter of day or two. Also, I will be tinkering
with the spectral-cubes so that I have a better understanding of its working
under the hood and come up with ways to integrate with the regions. It’s going
to be a very steep learning curve for sure , but that’s what challenges me and
makes this whole thing exciting and thrilling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Time to convert some caffeine into code, see you next week!&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;div class=&quot;toright&quot;&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Hey, it’s Sushobhana. Sushobhana Patra. That’s right. Don’t adjust your…whatever
        device you’re reading this on. It’s me, live and on medium. No return
        engagements, no encore, and this time, absolutely no requests. Get a snack.
        Settle in. Because I’m about to tell you the story of my summer. More
        specifically, what code did I develop this week under GSoC.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The coding period with astropy’s regions has started since the last two weeks.
It’s has been amazing since then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is Astropy? It is a community effort to provide core packages for astronomy
using python. The core package contains tons of various classes, utilities, and
a packaging framework intended to provide commonly-used astronomy tools. Just a
random fact, there are currently 10,000 active github original repositories
using Astropy out of which more than 1000 are on PyPI. Isn’t it amazing?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regions is an &lt;em&gt;astropy affliated package&lt;/em&gt; which deals with handling
regions(off-course!). Now, what are regions ? It is any considerable and
connected part of a space or surface studied in astronomy. It is basically used
to define an part of an image while analyzing and processing them.So, it
provides classes to handle regions with fixed shapes either using pixel or
celestial coordinates. There are several standard formats to express regions and
our package should be able to read as well as interpret those so that it gives a
common interface to many users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CASA , the &lt;em&gt;Common Astronomy Software Applications&lt;/em&gt; package, is a software which
focuses on various kinds of data processing from various radioastronomical
telescopes. It has several image processing tools and has CRTF format, CASA
Regions Text Format which provides flexible region definitions syntax for their
internal use. Now, being able to read this file format in the regions package
will gradually encourage/help the CASA users to experience similar tools that
Astropy provides.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My Project’s Title , “CASA CRTF REGION FILE HANDLING” pretty much sums off the
overall objective. Not only I have to implement an efficient Parser for reading
that file format, but also to implement the CRTF regions which are not presently
available in regions package. The CASA’s regions apart from describing the
euclidean geometry, also has spectral dimensions (the third dimension) which
needs to be implemented. The regions package aims to support various file
format(DS9 is already available) . Most of the parts are incontrovertible with
one another and it aims to provide interfaces and methods to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the first two weeks , I was focused to write a parser to convert CRTF region
strings to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Shape&lt;/code&gt; objects. &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Shape&lt;/code&gt; is an intermediate class which holds
sufficient information about the region from the deserialization of specific
file format. It contains method to convert them to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;region&lt;/code&gt; objects. I have
mostly used python’s regular expressions . There are few reason why I chose so.
First, It is an awesome, tiny, highly specialized language which is very
powerful. It lets you do all type of godly things with strings such as helps us
to match certain part of any crazy strings(people even parse html and xml codes
with this) and also extract particular parts of it. So, it does lexical analysis
very well. Since CRTF has a very simple one line syntax, the syntactical
analysis isn’t that big a deal. And the regex engine of python is completely
written in C which makes it super efficient. &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;re&lt;/code&gt; module seemed to be a perfect
match for this job. Oh!.. I forgot another reason, regex expressions are
difficult to understand to anyone who hasn’t seen this before, this makes me
look like a super coder!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1040/1*1wpnzKE3PuhrQMzZrQXufw.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actually, it contains a lot of meta-characters which have special meaning to
it.There are ways to dissect the strings by dividing the RE into groups. There
are many cool features such as look-ahead asssertions , greedy vs non-greedy
search, splitting , replacing to name a few. If you are in any way interested in
learning them, there is an official python HOWTO (
&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.python.org/3/howto/regex.html&quot;&gt;https://docs.python.org/3/howto/regex.html&lt;/a&gt;).It
is crisp, clear ,explains most of the features of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;re&lt;/code&gt; module and a perfect
tutorial for beginners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, the two weeks have been pretty rough,with the end-semester exams and all,
still, I have not let myself hamper the development pace.I implemented the whole
CRTF parser. Apart from a few issues such as mapping of CASA’s coordinate
systems to that of Astropy’s that needs to be addressed , it is almost
complete.I have also added documentations and tests to it. Here is the link to
the pull request:
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/astropy/regions/pull/173&quot;&gt;https://github.com/astropy/regions/pull/173&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week I am focusing on to handle meta attributes of the regions. There are
currently no documentations present so as to what kind of keys it allows and
also their domains. So, we have decided to work on creating a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;dict&lt;/code&gt; subclass so
that validity of the keys and values can be checked. We also have to make sure
that it is compatible with all the file formats that are present.Second thing
would be to work on serialization of DS9 region. Currently, it doesn’t use the
&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;shape&lt;/code&gt; layer which is kind of important if we want to convert from one file
format to another, such as CRTF to DS9 or vice-versa. Next thing would be to
implement regions that are currently not available such as symbol, text, vector,
box.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thats all for now, I just hope that I don’t get baked up in this 43 degree
Celsius hot and dry summer.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>sushobhana</name></author><category term="blog" /><category term="gsoc-2018" /><category term="astronomy" /><category term="programming" /><summary type="html"></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://localhost:4000/assets/images/astro.png" /></entry><entry><title type="html">GSoC-2018 - Community Bonding Period</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/GSoC-2018-Community-Bonding-Period/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="GSoC-2018 - Community Bonding Period" /><published>2018-05-16T22:44:00+05:30</published><updated>2018-05-16T22:44:00+05:30</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/GSoC-2018-Community-Bonding-Period</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/GSoC-2018-Community-Bonding-Period/">&lt;p&gt;Hi World,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am a 19 year old undergrad student from India majoring in Computer Science. I
have been selected in &lt;a href=&quot;https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Google Summer Of Code&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; as a student developer this
summer under the umbrella organization Open Astronomy.I will be spending the
next three months improving and implementing new functionalities to the
&lt;a href=&quot;https://astropy-regions.readthedocs.io/en/latest/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;regions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.astropy.org/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;astropy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; affiliated python package. I will be explaining all
about this and my project with complete details in my further posts. Here is a
link to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#5210718853398528&quot;&gt;project idea&lt;/a&gt; .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to dive deeper, this is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://drive.google.com/file/d/19R7qbI-AQA85FgzJfiiMbihB1DpB1Bqr/view?usp=sharing&quot;&gt;project proposal&lt;/a&gt; that I had submitted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You must be thinking, why didn’t I just describe my project and dive into
technicalities?? Well, we have the whole summer to discuss that !&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this post, I just want to focus on the GSoC part and how much this program
means to me. For those of you don’t know about GSoC, it is an international
program sponsored by google where students are paid over to work on various open
source projects over their summer vacations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You get to work on projects used by thousands of people, interacting closely
with the open source community and you are paid for this! I couldn’t think of a
better summer. If you are a university student who happens to love programming
and solving bugs you might consider applying for GSoC next year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The journey so far in the astropy community has been splendid.I initially
started contributing a few PRs to the astropy core around december.The community
was very welcoming and patient enough to review my PR for several iterations.I
was completely new to git and github’s workflow and was working on a public code
base for the first time. I was simultaneously learning Python . And to add on
top of that I was completely new to the jargons used by the astronomers.It all
had a very steep learning curve , but it was worth it. I learnt a lot, starting
from documenting the code to writing test cases for it. I understood how to
write clean codes with better design and how much important it is to write
readable code. These things may seem trivial to many but avoiding premature
optimization is an art in itself!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jokes Apart, I am grateful to taldcroft and Simon for initially reviewing my PRs
without losing their temper!😀The initial kick-start was very important for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I started looking for projects after the org announcements, the regions
project seemed very interesting to me and I started writing a proposal for it. I
would like to thank Adam Ginsburg(also my mentor), the project lead for regions
package who responded to each of my queries , helping me understand the scope of
the project. He was also kind enough to review my proposal for a couple of
times. I would also like to thank Miguel , my second mentor for reviewing the
proposal and providing me with valuable inputs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would also like to thank Brigitta and David , the org admins for making this
whole process easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The results were announced on 23rd April,2018 .The community-bonding period
began and ended on 14th May. I was on cloud nine for a couple of days and it
took me around a week to actually sync that in. This was the time to learn more
about my community , setting developement installs , chalking out the objectives
and learning new things that I might need while coding away this summer. I
pretty much did everything in these three weeks. Also I have my end semester
exam starting this week , so I ensured I started out little early so that I
could be on schedule.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first part of my project is to implement CRTF File reader(It is a region
file format having a specific syntax). This needed some regular expressions for
string matching. Regular expression is an awesome language for string matching
and is provided in Python through the re module. I spent some time understanding
this and started writing the skeleton of the parser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The parser is close to complete now. There are a couple of issues that needs to
be addressed along with writing tests. I will be writing more about how I
approached to the design and my experience with regular expression, in the next
week along with my PR details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far it is all nice. The experience has been amazing . Looking forward to all
the challenges ahead!!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;star&quot;&gt;Star&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can give evidence to a post. Just add the tag to the markdown file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-raw&quot; data-lang=&quot;raw&quot;&gt;star: true&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;especial-breaker&quot;&gt;Especial Breaker&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can add a especial &lt;em&gt;hr&lt;/em&gt; to your text.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot; data-lang=&quot;html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;breaker&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;breaker&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;spoiler&quot;&gt;Spoiler&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can add an especial hidden content that appears on hover.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot; data-lang=&quot;html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;spoiler&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;your content&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;codepen&quot;&gt;Codepen&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can add Pens from Codepen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot; data-lang=&quot;html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;p&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;data-height=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;268&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;data-theme-id=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;0&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;data-slug-hash=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;gfdDu&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;data-default-tab=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;result&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;data-user=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;chriscoyier&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'codepen'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;slideshare&quot;&gt;Slideshare&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add your presentations here!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot; data-lang=&quot;html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;iframe&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;src=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;//www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/key/hqDhSJoWkrHe7l&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;width=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;560&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;height=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;310&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;frameborder=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;0&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;marginwidth=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;0&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;marginheight=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;0&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;scrolling=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;no&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;style=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;border:1px solid #CCC; border-width:1px; margin-bottom:5px; max-width: 100%;&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;allowfullscreen&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/iframe&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;videos&quot;&gt;Videos&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you want some videos? Youtube, Vimeo or Vevo? Copy the embed code and paste on your post!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot; data-lang=&quot;html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;iframe&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;width=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;560&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;height=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;310&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;src=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/r7XhWUDj-Ts&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;frameborder=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;0&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;allowfullscreen&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/iframe&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This note &lt;strong&gt;demonstrates&lt;/strong&gt; some of what &lt;a href=&quot;http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/&quot;&gt;Markdown&lt;/a&gt; is &lt;em&gt;capable of doing&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s how to do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot; data-lang=&quot;html&quot;&gt;This note **demonstrates** some of what [Markdown][some/link] is *capable of doing*.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;headings&quot;&gt;Headings&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are six levels of headings. They correspond with the six levels of HTML headings. You’ve probably noticed them already in the page. Each level down uses one more hash character. But we are using just 4 of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;headings-can-be-small&quot;&gt;Headings can be small&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;headings-can-be-small-1&quot;&gt;Headings can be small&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;headings-can-be-small-2&quot;&gt;Headings can be small&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;headings-can-be-small-3&quot;&gt;Headings can be small&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-raw&quot; data-lang=&quot;raw&quot;&gt;# Heading
## Heading
### Heading
#### Heading&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;lists&quot;&gt;Lists&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ordered-list&quot;&gt;Ordered list&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Item 1&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A second item&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Number 3&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-raw&quot; data-lang=&quot;raw&quot;&gt;1. Item 1
2. A second item
3. Number 3&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;unordered-list&quot;&gt;Unordered list&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;An item&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Another item&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Yet another item&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;And there’s more…&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-raw&quot; data-lang=&quot;raw&quot;&gt;* An item
* Another item
* Yet another item
* And there's more...&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;paragraph-modifiers&quot;&gt;Paragraph modifiers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Quote&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Here is a quote. What this is should be self explanatory. Quotes are automatically indented when they are used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-raw&quot; data-lang=&quot;raw&quot;&gt;&amp;gt; Here is a quote. What this is should be self explanatory.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;urls&quot;&gt;URLs&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;URLs can be made in a handful of ways:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A named link to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.markitdown.net/&quot;&gt;Mark It Down&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Another named link to &lt;a href=&quot;http://markitdown.net/&quot;&gt;Mark It Down&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sometimes you just want a URL like &lt;a href=&quot;http://markitdown.net/&quot;&gt;http://markitdown.net/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-raw&quot; data-lang=&quot;raw&quot;&gt;* A named link to [MarkItDown][3].
* Another named link to [MarkItDown](http://markitdown.net/)
* Sometimes you just want a URL like &amp;lt;http://markitdown.net/&amp;gt;.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;Horizontal rule&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A horizontal rule is a line that goes across the middle of the page.
It’s sometimes handy for breaking things up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-raw&quot; data-lang=&quot;raw&quot;&gt;---&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;images&quot;&gt;Images&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Markdown can also contain images. I’ll need to add something here sometime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-raw&quot; data-lang=&quot;raw&quot;&gt;![Markdowm Image][/image/url]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://kune.fr/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/ghost-blog.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Markdowm Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure Caption&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-raw&quot; data-lang=&quot;raw&quot;&gt;![Markdowm Image][/image/url]
&amp;lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption&quot;&amp;gt;Photo by John Doe&amp;lt;/figcaption&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://kune.fr/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/ghost-blog.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Markdowm Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Photo by John Doe&lt;/figcaption&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bigger Images&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-raw&quot; data-lang=&quot;raw&quot;&gt;![Markdowm Image][/image/url]{: class=&quot;bigger-image&quot; }&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://kune.fr/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/ghost-blog.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Markdowm Image&quot; class=&quot;bigger-image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;code&quot;&gt;Code&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A HTML Example:&lt;/p&gt;
